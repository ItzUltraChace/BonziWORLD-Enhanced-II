# BonziWORLD Enhanced

**This bonziworld respository houses the source code to BonziWORLD: Enhanced.**
<br>
The source code has been made public because I would like to move on from this project and work on something else. Since it's just been sitting here collecting dust, I figured I should make this public. Who knows, maybe somebody will find this useful.
<br><br>
## What is this?
BonziWORLD Enhanced is a fork of vanilla BonziWORLD which provides simple qol improvements and bug fixes to the original.
<br><br>
## What features make this different than vanilla BonziWORLD?
Some changes which make this stand out from the standard code by [heyjoeway](https://github.com/heyjoeway/BonziWORLD):
- Decompressed bonzibuddy sprites (HD)
- Custom BonziBuddy sprites from the web (crosscolors)
- A chat logger
- Browser notifications for new chat messages
- Random godwords for people using [replit](https://replit.com) or [glitch](https://glitch.me)
- Lipsync for SpeakJS (also fixes the memory leaks)
- Playlist and shorts support for /youtube
- /spotify and /soundcloud allowing you to listen to your favorite artists inside BonziWORLD
- /image, /audio & /video allows you to post media to a bonziworld chat room
- A handful of new emotes
- Pre-configured custom themes
- Decent Youtube and link XSS bug fixes
- Updated dependencies
