# Notice of discontinuation

<hr>

### BWE is to be slowly discontinued and replaced near the end of 2025 with BWI (BWE 2 codenamed Uraninite)
#### BWI will feature a fully rebuilt codebase with a focus on stability and performance. I have come to realize that BWE is too much of a fucking chore to optimize and that i'd be better off starting from scratch.
##### BWI will have all of BWE's hallmarks (it's features, *improvements*, bug fixes, etc.) so there won't be a need to worry because the transition will be seamless!
